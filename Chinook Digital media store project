#In this SQL, I'm querying a database called chinook, which represents a digital media store, with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.. 


#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country<> 'US';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country ='Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country. 
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.customerid=c.customerid
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#4. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, v.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices v
ON v.customerid= c.CustomerId;

#5. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId

#6. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT a.name AS artist, t.Name AS Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
JOIN chinook.albums al
ON al.albumid=t.albumid
JOIN chinook.artists a
ON a.artistid=al.artistid;
