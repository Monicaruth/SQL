#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about the top 50 most listened songs in the world for year 2021 in Spotify. 

#1. What is the average danceability by artist and track? 

SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY id ORDER BY danceability;

#2. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc 
LIMIT 10;

#3. What artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
LIMIT 1;

#4. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT track_name, popularity, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#5. Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH popularity_CTE AS (SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM spotifydata GROUP BY artist_name)
SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'top star' as tag FROM popularity_CTE 
WHERE average_popularity >= 90;
